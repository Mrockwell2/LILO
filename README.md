## Python Virtual Environment

### Creating a Python Virtual Environment

For development outside of the Bridges-2 interface, you can create a Python Virtual Environment to run and test the model. To do so type ``` make env ``` in the base directory.

### Using the Python Virtual Environment

To activate the venv just type ``` source resources/env/ohana/bin/activate ``` in the base directory.

Deactivating the venv just requires you to type ``` deactivate ```

### Install the required Packages in the Virtual Environment

Type ``` pip install -r resources/env/requirements.txt ```
